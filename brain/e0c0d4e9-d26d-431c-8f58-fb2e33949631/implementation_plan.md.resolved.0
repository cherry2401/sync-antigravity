# Configure Claude Code with cliproxy

Claude Code allows routing API requests through a proxy server by modifying the base URL environment variable.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Environment Variable**: Set `CLAUDE_BASE_URL` to the address of your `cliproxy` instance.
2. **Terminal Session**: Export the variable in the current terminal session.
3. **Persistence**: (Optional) Add the variable to system environment variables for permanent use.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Run `claude` and check if it connects via the proxy.
- Use `claude --debug api` to verify requests are being sent to the correct endpoint.
