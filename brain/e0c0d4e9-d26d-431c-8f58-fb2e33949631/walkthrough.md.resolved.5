# Walkthrough - Fixed Title Bar Logo

I have replaced the placeholder `Zap` icon in the title bar with the actual project logo asset.

## Changes Made

### [clawdbot-client](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/clawdbot-client)

- **Logo Asset**: Created the `src/assets` folder and copied [icon128.png](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/chrome-extension/icons/icon128.png) from the `chrome-extension` folder as [logo.png](file:///I:/AIHub/claude-manager/src/renderer/src/assets/logo.png).
- **TitleBar Update**: Modified [TitleBar.tsx](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/clawdbot-client/src/components/TitleBar.tsx) to import and display the new logo image.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- The app was restarted and the title bar now correctly displays the logo.

> [!NOTE]
> The logo fits perfectly within the title bar height and maintains its aspect ratio.
