# Fix `spawn` Error on Windows

The installation/dev script [scripts/run-node.mjs](file:///g:/AIHub/clawdbot/scripts/run-node.mjs) fails on Windows with an `EINVAL` error because it attempts to `spawn('pnpm.cmd')` directly without `shell: true`.

## Proposed Changes

### [scripts]
#### [MODIFY] [run-node.mjs](file:///g:/AIHub/clawdbot/scripts/run-node.mjs)
- Update `spawn` call at line 117 to use `pnpm` instead of `pnpm.cmd`.
- Add `shell: true` to the `spawn` options to ensure cross-platform compatibility and correct execution of the npm command.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `pnpm dev --help` to verify the script can now execute without error.
- Verify `pnpm build` still works (though it was working before, this script invokes it when dist is stale).
