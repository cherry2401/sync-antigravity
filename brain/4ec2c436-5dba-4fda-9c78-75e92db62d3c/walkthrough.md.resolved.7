# Walkthrough - Extension Connection Fix 🟢

We have successfully resolved the issue where the Chrome Extension could not connect to the App Client, and the status bar was stuck on orange.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed HTTP Preflight Error
The extension sends an `HTTP HEAD` request to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/` before establishing a WebSocket connection. Previously, the server returned a `404 Not Found`, which blocked the extension.
- **Fix:** Added a handler for the root path (`/`) in [browserRelay.ts](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/clawdbot-client/electron/services/browserRelay.ts) to return `200 OK`.
- **Improvements:** Added CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) to ensure the browser doesn't block the request.

### 2. Status Bar Color Update
The StatusBar was previously programmed to show Orange (`Ext Only`) when only the extension was connected.
- **Fix:** Updated [StatusBar.tsx](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/clawdbot-client/src/components/StatusBar.tsx) to treat Extension connections as a success state (Green 🟢).
- **New Label:** "🟢 Browser Relay" - clearly indicating the browser is ready for control.

### 3. Structural Code Repair
Fixed a syntax error in [browserRelay.ts](file:///f:/Python/OpenSSH/clawdbot-client/electron/services/browserRelay.ts) that caused the class to be closed prematurely, ensuring all methods are properly accessible.

## Verification Results

### Terminal Logs
The logs clearly show the successful preflight and WebSocket connection:
```text
[1] 🌐 [BrowserRelay] HTTP HEAD /
[1] 🌐 [BrowserRelay] Extension connected from: ::ffff:127.0.0.1  
[1] 🌐 [BrowserRelay] 🔌 Extension WebSocket connected!
```

### UI Status
- ✅ **Extension Badge:** Automatically turns **ON**.
- ✅ **App StatusBar:** Displays **🟢 Browser Relay** in green.

The bot is now fully "thông nòng" and ready to control Chrome! 🚀
