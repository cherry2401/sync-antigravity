# Admin Dashboard Overhaul Plan

## Goal Description
Transform the current basic Admin Dashboard into a professional, modular, and feature-rich administration system. The goal is to provide specific management capabilities for Listings, Users, and Content, along with high-level analytics to track platform performance.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a major refactor. The existing [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///i:/Website/BDS/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx) will be broken down into a layout component and several page/feature components.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Architecture Refactoring
Break down the monolithic [AdminDashboard.tsx](file:///i:/Website/BDS/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx) into:
- **`AdminLayout`**: Sidebar navigation and Top header (User profile, notifications).
- **`AdminOverview`**: The landing page with statistics and charts.
- **`AdminListings`**: Advanced table for listing management.
- **`AdminUsers`**: New section for user management.
- **`AdminNews`**: Content management system.

### 2. Dashboard Overview (New)
Implement a "Command Center" view containing:
- **Stats Cards**: Total Listings, New Users (Today/Week), Total Views, Revenue (Mock).
- **Activity Chart**: Visual representation of views/listings over time (using Recharts or CSS-based charts).
- **Recent Activity**: Log of latest actions (User X posted Listing Y).

### 3. Listing Management Enhancements
Upgrade the current grid view to a powerful management table:
- **Tabbed View**: All | Pending Approval | Active | Rejected.
- **Quick Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons directly in the list.
- **Filtering**: Filter by Province, Price Range, Type.
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for listing status.

### 4. User Management (New)
Create a new section to manage user accounts:
- **User List**: Table showing Name, Email, Phone, Role, Join Date.
- **Actions**: View details, Ban/Unban user, Reset password (mock).

### 5. News & Content
- Improve the editor experience (Rich text or better layout).
- Manage "Featured" news items.

## Detailed Component Structure

### `src/components/admin/`
#### [NEW] `AdminLayout.tsx`
- Sidebar with navigation links.
- Responsive design.

#### [NEW] `AdminOverview.tsx`
- `StatsCard` component.
- `ActivityChart` component.

#### [NEW] `AdminListings.tsx`
- Data table for listings.
- Filter/Search bar.

#### [NEW] `AdminUsers.tsx`
- Data table for users.

#### [MODIFY] `AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Refactor to be the main router/controller that renders `AdminLayout` and switches between the sub-components based on state.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Navigation**: Verify switching between tabs (Dashboard, Listings, Users, News) works smoothly without page reload.
- **Interactive Elements**: Test Approve/Reject buttons on listings.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the dashboard looks good on tablet/desktop.
- **Data Integrity**: Verify that editing a listing in Admin reflects in the public view.
