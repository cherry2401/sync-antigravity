# Walkthrough - Interest Rate Calculator Redesign

I have completely redesigned the Interest Rate Calculator (`/lai-suat`) to match the visual style and functionality of the requested reference site.

## Changes Verified

### 1. Bank Interest Rate Lookup
- **Full Bank List**: Added real bank options (Vietcombank, Techcombank, Standard Chartered, HSBC, etc.) extracted from the reference site.
- **Deposit Terms**: Added accurate term options (1 - 36 months).
- **UI Match**: Replicated the "Tìm lãi suất ngân hàng" section with radio buttons and bold red result text.

### 2. Loan Calculator Form
- **Input Styling**: Implemented inputs with internal suffixes ("VND", "Tháng", "% / năm") as requested.
- **Layout**: Aligned labels and inputs in a dense, structured grid similar to the reference.
- **Result Button**: Styled the "Xem kết quả" button with the specific red color and spacing.

### 3. Calculation & Results
- **Amortization Schedule**: Verified the detailed monthly table generations.
- **Summary Blocks**: Confirmed the display of Total Principal, Total Interest (Red), and Total Payment (Blue).
