# Fix video_inline post type routing

The `post_type` "video_inline" is currently failing to route to the "video" output because the "Switch Post Type" node uses a strict equality check for the string "video".

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will map `video_inline` to the **video** output. If you prefer it to be mapped to **reel**, please let me know.

## Proposed Changes

### Workflow
#### [MODIFY] [REPOST FACEBOOK.json](file:///c:/Users/Cherry/Clone_facebook/Test%20WF/REPOST%20FACEBOOK.json)
- Update the "Switch Post Type" node (id: `ba65b030-2b44-4010-9fc8-82a7ba609c43`)
- Change the condition for the "video" output to accept both `video` and `video_inline`.
- I will use an expression-based condition: `{{ $json.post_type === 'video' || $json.post_type === 'video_inline' }}` equals `true`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- I cannot run the workflow directly as it requires webhook triggers and external credentials.
- I will verify the file content changes to ensure the JSON structure is correct and the logic is implemented as intended.

### Manual Verification
- The user should trigger the workflow with a `video_inline` post and verify it follows the "video" path.
