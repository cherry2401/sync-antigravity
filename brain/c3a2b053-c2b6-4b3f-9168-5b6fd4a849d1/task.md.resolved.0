# Backup Credentials Workflow Fix

## Problem
- Original workflow used `n8n-nodes-base.n8n` API node which returns 404 error due to hosting API configuration issues
- Need to adapt workflow to use custom `n8n-nodes-backup-credentials` node instead

## Tasks

### Main Workflow
- [x] Replace "Get many workflows" node with "Backup credentials" custom node
- [x] Add Code node to parse binary data into JSON array (29 credentials parsed)
- [ ] Update "Loop Over Items" to process credentials
- [ ] Modify "Execute Workflow" trigger to handle credential data

### Subworkflow  
- [ ] Update "Get file data" GitHub node to use credential ID instead of workflow ID
- [ ] Modify "isDiffOrNew" Code node to compare credentials instead of workflows
- [ ] Update GitHub "Create new file" node with correct file path for credentials
- [ ] Update GitHub "Edit existing file" node with correct file path for credentials

### Testing
- [ ] Test single credential backup
- [ ] Test loop through all credentials
- [ ] Verify GitHub file structure
