Style: Minimalist with subtle dividers, (+) icon on the right that rotates to (×) when open.

### Component 2: Product Detail Page

#### [MODIFY] `app/san-pham/[slug]/page.tsx`

1. **Replace description paragraph** (line 269-274) with `<ProductAccordion />` component
2. **Reorder sections**: Move Related Products above Reviews
3. **Add Sticky Bottom Bar**: Mobile-only fixed bar with Chat + Buy buttons
4. **Import new icons**: `MessageCircle` for chat icon

### Component 3: Product Reviews with Pagination

#### [MODIFY] [components/product/ProductReviews.tsx](file:///i:/Website/MyphamHaKi/app-src/src/components/product/ProductReviews.tsx)

1. **Add pagination** instead of "Show All" button
2. **Limit to 3 reviews per page** with page numbers (1, 2, 3...)
3. **Reduce section padding** to bring it closer to main content

4. Scroll to Reviews:
   - [ ] Only 3 reviews visible initially
