# Token Capture - Debugging Request Body

## Current Status
- [x] Added detailed logging to [formatRequestBody()](file:///d:/EXTENTIONS/Chrome%20VEO%203.1/background.js#81-125)
- [ ] **TESTING NEEDED** - User to reload extension + create video
- [ ] Analyze console logs to see requestBody structure
- [ ] Fix based on actual data structure

## Expected Console Output
```
[formatRequestBody] requestBody keys: [...]
[formatRequestBody] has formData? ...
[formatRequestBody] has raw? ...
[formatRequestBody] Decoded text preview: ...
```

## Next Steps After Logs
- Fix formatRequestBody based on actual structure
- Extract token correctly
- Auto-send to webhook
