# Token Capture - Diagnosis Phase

## Approach: WebRequest API (background.js)
- [x] Added detailed logging for token extraction
- [x] Auto-send to webhook when token found
- [ ] **TESTING NEEDED** - Reload extension + create video
- [ ] Check console for exact error

## Possible Issues
- Body not captured by webRequest
- Token in different field  
- Parsing error

## Next After Diagnosis
- Fix based on console logs
- Update workflow to use tokens
